SwapSkillz — Skill Exchange Platform
Overview

SwapSkillz is a peer-to-peer skill exchange platform that enables users to learn new skills by exchanging their own expertise instead of paying money. The platform is built with a real-world product mindset, focusing on usability, clarity, and scalability.

How the Platform Works

Users create profiles showcasing the skills they offer and the skills they want to learn.

A centralized marketplace allows users to discover skills shared by others.

Users can send structured exchange requests for specific skills.

Requests can be accepted or rejected, with clear status tracking.

Messaging is unlocked only after an exchange is accepted.

Conversations open automatically with the selected user for a seamless experience.
